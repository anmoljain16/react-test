Assignment: Create a React App
Objective: The objective of this assignment is to apply your knowledge of function components, state, props, and event handling in React to create a simple application.
Instructions:
Set up the React Environment:
Use the Create React App or vite  tool to create a new React project.
Delete the default files and clean up the project structure.
Create Components:
Create a functional component called App as the main component.
Create a functional component called Header to display a header for your app.
Create a functional component called Form to render a form for user input.
Create a functional component called Output to display the result.
State and Props:
In the App component, define a state variable to store user input.
Pass the state variable as a prop to the Form component.
Pass a callback function as a prop to the Form component to handle form submission.
Pass the result as a prop to the Output component.
Event Handling:
In the Form component, create a form with an input field and a submit button.
Handle the onChange event of the input field to update the state with user input.
Handle the form submission by calling the callback function passed from the App component.
Render Components:
In the App component, render the Header, Form, and Output components.
Display the user input in the Output component.
Styling (Optional):
Add CSS styles to enhance the visual appearance of your app.
You can use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or custom styles.
Test your App:
Run your React app and test the functionality.
Verify that user input is correctly displayed in the output.
Bonus Tasks (Optional):
Implement validation for the user input in the Form component.
Add additional features or components to enhance your app.
Submission Guidelines:
Create a GitHub repository for your project and commit your code regularly.
Submit the link to your GitHub repository or share the code files with your instructor or evaluator.
